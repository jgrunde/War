# War
Burke's famous WW1 game, where everyone's alliances are meaningless.

This will become a digital recreation of Burke's great game where Japan never gets a break. Make treaties with other countries and hope they'll defend you. Buy troops and industry at the Magical Shop of Stuff and declare war on Japan.

Feel free to suggest edits and features.
